## Knowledge Transfer for custom Cookie-cutter,Mlflow, Data versioning with DVC Git versioning,Python code linter flake8 and code formatting using Black

-----------------------------------

### Getting started

* Since we are following a specific modified cookie cutter for ml-projects first download structure from here [project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/117FUpr-tvNRYJGuLw2XxE7vSpxX9i0rb?usp=sharing) 

* Download the folder and rename foldername. Then 
```
cd foldername

* Download [requirements.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GZVDzBSC2OAp1ilGpbZHiz0LnQMW87-T/view?usp=sharing) and install dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tracking code and data

Before initilizing add virtual environment folder to .gitignore file

Now follow the steps inside data folder README.md file.

### Mlflow experiment tracking

For a detailed walk-through on how to track model metrics ,model version download the folder [mlflow](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LY8O4atzZiCQMb_7t2saLoGFxqPBlX6u?usp=sharing) and save inside notebooks folder.

### Code quality and Formatting

For learning to use flake8 and black download the file [requirements.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nVTflC2pjufE3QLR9D_hEFTjB2M34csO/view?usp=sharing) from drive.
